# HR Job Isolation Implementation

## Overview
This document explains the implementation of HR job isolation, ensuring that HR users can only see and manage jobs they created, not jobs created by other HR users.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Jobs API (`/api/jobs/`)

#### **JobListCreateView (GET/POST)**
- **Students**: Can see all active jobs
- **HR Users**: Can only see jobs they created (`posted_by=user`)
- **Other Roles**: See no jobs

#### **JobDetailView (GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE)**
- **Students**: Can view/access active jobs
- **HR Users**: Can only view/edit/delete jobs they created
- **Other Roles**: No access

#### **close_job endpoint**
- Already restricted to `posted_by=request.user` (only job creator can close)

### 2. HR Dashboard API (`/api/hr/dashboard/`)

#### **HRDashboardStatsView**
- **Active Jobs**: Only counts jobs created by authenticated HR user
- **Total Applications**: Only counts applications for jobs created by authenticated HR user
- **Response Rate**: Calculated based on applications for jobs created by authenticated HR user
- **Recent Activity**: Shows applications and meetings only for jobs created by authenticated HR user
- **Breakdowns**: All statistics filtered by `job__posted_by=request.user`

#### **HRDashboardJobsView**
- **Queryset**: `Job.objects.filter(posted_by=request.user)`
- **Summary Statistics**: Only includes jobs created by authenticated HR user
- **Application Counts**: Only counts applications for jobs created by authenticated HR user

#### **HRDashboardApplicationsView**
- **Queryset**: `Application.objects.filter(job__posted_by=request.user)`
- **Summary Statistics**: Only includes applications for jobs created by authenticated HR user

### 3. Meetings API (`/api/meetings/`)

#### **MeetingListCreateView**
- **Students**: Can see meetings they're attending
- **HR Users**: Can only see meetings for jobs they created (`application__job__posted_by=user`)
- **Other Roles**: See all meetings

#### **MeetingDetailView**
- **Students**: Can view meetings they're attending
- **HR Users**: Can only view meetings for jobs they created
- **Other Roles**: Can view all meetings

#### **MeetingStatsView**
- **Students**: Statistics for meetings they're attending
- **HR Users**: Statistics only for meetings related to jobs they created
- **Other Roles**: Statistics for all meetings

#### **Meeting Management Endpoints**
- **reschedule_meeting**: Already restricted by queryset filtering
- **cancel_meeting**: Already restricted by queryset filtering
- **complete_meeting**: Already restricted by queryset filtering
- **add_attendee/remove_attendee**: Already restricted by queryset filtering

## Database Queries

### Jobs Filtering
```python
# HR users see only their jobs
Job.objects.filter(posted_by=request.user)
```

### Applications Filtering
```python
# HR users see applications only for their jobs
Application.objects.filter(job__posted_by=request.user)
```

### Meetings Filtering
```python
# HR users see meetings only for jobs they created
Meeting.objects.filter(application__job__posted_by=request.user)
```

## Security Benefits

1. **Data Isolation**: HR users cannot see or manage jobs created by other HR users
2. **Privacy**: Job details, applications, and meetings are completely isolated
3. **Access Control**: Each HR user has their own "workspace"
4. **Audit Trail**: Clear ownership of all job-related data

## User Experience

### For HR Users
- Dashboard shows only their job postings and related data
- Cannot accidentally modify other HR users' jobs
- Clean, focused view of their responsibilities

### For Students
- Can see all active job postings (unchanged)
- Can apply to any active job (unchanged)

### For System Administrators
- Can see all data (if they have appropriate permissions)
- Clear separation of HR user responsibilities

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: HR User A vs HR User B
1. HR User A creates Job A
2. HR User B creates Job B
3. HR User A should only see Job A
4. HR User B should only see Job B
5. Neither should see the other's jobs

### Test Case 2: Applications Isolation
1. Job A gets 5 applications
2. Job B gets 3 applications
3. HR User A dashboard shows 5 total applications
4. HR User B dashboard shows 3 total applications

### Test Case 3: Meetings Isolation
1. Job A has 2 scheduled meetings
2. Job B has 1 scheduled meeting
3. HR User A sees 2 meetings in stats
4. HR User B sees 1 meeting in stats

## API Endpoints Affected

- `GET/POST /api/jobs/`
- `GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /api/jobs/{id}/`
- `POST /api/jobs/{id}/close/`
- `GET /api/hr/dashboard/stats/`
- `GET /api/hr/dashboard/jobs/`
- `GET /api/hr/dashboard/applications/`
- `GET/POST /api/meetings/`
- `GET/PUT/PATCH/DELETE /api/meetings/{id}/`
- `GET /api/meetings/stats/`
- All meeting management endpoints

## Conclusion

The HR job isolation implementation ensures complete data separation between HR users while maintaining the existing functionality for students and other roles. Each HR user operates in their own isolated environment, seeing only the jobs they created and all related data (applications, meetings, statistics).
